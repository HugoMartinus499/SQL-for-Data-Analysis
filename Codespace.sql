-- SELECT statement is to select the columns, * means all columns
-- FROM statement is to select the database
-- LIMIT statement is to limit number of rows
-- Always use a ; when executing and statements should be capital letters
-- ORDER BY should always go between FROM and LIMIT, 
-- ORDER BY sorts in ascending order, add DESC to sort in descending order
-- ASC to sort in ascending order, order is determined by what it is next to
-- WHERE statement goes after FROM but before ORDER BY, it is a filtering statement
-- WHERE statement can also be used for non-numeric, just a ' on either side eg. 'Company Name'
-- AS statement can be used to name columns created as a result of arithmetic procedures
-- LIKE statement can be used in conjunction with WHERE to filter for partial filters
-- Using a wildcard like '%' in LIKE statement informs search, 
    -- % before string searches for any number of characters before string, ie. "ends with"
    -- % after string searches for any number of characters after string, ie. "starts with"
    -- % before and after string searches for number of characters before and after, ie. "contains"
-- IN statement can be used in conjunction with WHERE to filter for multiple identifiers, works like "is one of"
-- NOT statement is great in conjunction with LIKE and IN to find all registrations not fitting criteria, works like "is not"
-- AND and BETWEEN  operators are good for intervals and stacking filters
-- OR is great for finding differences in the data, can be used with all other operators using parentheses to stack filters
-- JOIN is used with ON to pull data from multiple tables, ON is used to determine what columnn is used to JOIN the tables
-- Aliases can be used to not have to type out long table names, can be done with the AS statement or with just a space after the name and then the alias
-- It is important to name columns, otherwise they might fuse together when joining
-- LEFT and RIGHT JOIN are effectively interchangable. If the right table contains extra rows, the query can be switched around so the right table is now the left table
-- Filtering using an AND clause when also using LEFT JOIN instead of the WHERE joins all rows but only populates the field of the AND clause when the filter is met
-- NULL occurs most often when data is missing or after a LEFT JOIN, where some rows don't fit the criteria and are therefore not populated
-- Agregate functions should be written after SELECT statement and the following field should be in brackets
-- COUNT function returns number of 
-- COUNT function does not include NULL fields
-- SUM function sums values, can therefore only be used for numeric fields. NULL is treated as 0
-- MIN and MAX can be used on all operators, it returns lowest or highest numeric value, earliest or latest date and closest to A in the alphabet or closest to Z in the alphabet
-- AVG function ignores NULLs, so if NULLS need to be 0, the average must be hardcoded using arithmetic and SUM and COUNT
-- Mean is calculated in SQL using the AVG function, Mode and Median is a bit tricky
-- GROUP BY can be used to aggregate data within subsets of the data. For example, grouping for different accounts, different regions, or different sales representatives
-- The GROUP BY always goes between WHERE and ORDER BY.
-- Any column in the SELECT statement that is not within an aggregator must be in the GROUP BY clause.
-- DISTINCT can be used instead of COUNT and the GROUP BY clause. It works like Number of Unique. NOTE: it can slow down the query significantly when using aggregation
-- HAVING is used as an alternative to the WHERE clause, when filtering on a part of the query that has been created using an aggregate
-- HAVING goes between the GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses
